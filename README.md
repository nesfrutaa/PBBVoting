# Big Brother Voting DApp

This is a decentralized voting application built on Ethereum, allowing users to vote for their favorite contestants in a secure, transparent, and decentralized manner using MetaMask.

---

## Features

- **Connect MetaMask Wallet**: Allows users to connect their Ethereum wallet.
- **View Contestants**: Displays a list of contestants with their current vote counts.
- **Vote for Contestants**: Users can cast a vote for their favorite contestant, and the results are updated in real-time.
- **Ethereum Smart Contract**: All votes are recorded on the blockchain, ensuring transparency and security.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

1. [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/) browser extension installed.
2. Node.js and npm installed on your local machine.
3. Ethereum test network setup (e.g., Hardhat, Ganache).

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/big-brother-voting-dapp.git
   cd big-brother-voting-dapp
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. Deploy the smart contract to your local or test Ethereum network and update the `contractAddress` in the code.

## How It Works

1. **Connect Wallet**: Users are prompted to connect their MetaMask wallet.
2. **Smart Contract Interaction**:
   - Fetch the list of contestants and their vote counts from the blockchain.
   - Submit a transaction to cast a vote for a specific contestant.
3. **Real-Time Updates**: The app listens to blockchain events to update the vote counts dynamically.
